# Random Forest for Classification for Regression 
This project is a collaboration between me and Sneha khirwal.

## Analysis
The analysis is based on the data published by University of california (UCI). It contains Synchronous machine data obtained in real time from the experimental operating environment.

The purpose of the analysis of this dataset is to build a model to  estimate the excitation current of Synchronous Machine using Random Forest algorithm. To improve the accuracy, We did EDA and also determined the importance of the features. The features with highest impact are consider in training the model.

## The steps we follow are :
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Evaluation
